# Christopher C. Ullmann - Verified Biography

## Background & Early Life

- Grew up in the Southeast US, moved around frequently as a kid. My mom was climbing the corporate ladder, which meant new schools, new towns, new faces regularly.
- That constant change taught me adaptability early. I had to remake friends over and over, which built the social skills and ability to connect with people that later became one of my biggest professional strengths.
- Around age 8-10, I got fascinated with cars: tinkering, understanding how things work, making them better. That car passion carried into adulthood. I have built race cars, always loved improving and making things faster. The Builder started in the garage.
- I went into the Air Force young instead of going straight to college.
- After the military, I went to college in North Carolina (Queens University of Charlotte). I explored engineering, then political science, before landing in biology. I was not unfocused; I was looking for the right system to study. Biology clicked because I saw it the same way I saw everything else: as a machine. How does it work? What are the systems? How can you understand and improve them? That systems thinking lens is something I apply to everything, whether it is a human body, a manufacturing line, or a global supply chain.
- I thought I wanted to be a doctor, but I got deep into the science and that led to my first job: a validation technician at a pharmaceutical plant. Not what I planned out of college, but it was a job, and it launched a career I never expected.

## Core Identity: "The Builder"

The central theme of my career is the concept of building. It started as a kid tinkering with cars and has never stopped. It is not just a job description but a framework I apply to everything: optimizing global supply chains, leading AI transformation, navigating complex organizational change, building race cars, or calibrating a racing sim rig at home. The underlying mechanism is always engineering: identify the desired state, analyze the current variables, and construct the most efficient path to optimization.

I have been described as "The Integrated Man," a rare convergence of industrial-era discipline and information-age agility. I combine 25+ years of manufacturing, quality, and supply chain operations with deep, hands-on AI expertise.

## The Key Differentiator: "The Translator"

Leaders at Microsoft, Engineering, and senior business leaders have told me I have a rare skill as a translator between business and technology. Most people are either:
- Technical but cannot communicate with business stakeholders
- Business-savvy but cannot go deep on the technology
- Can talk both languages but cannot actually build anything

I do all three. I bridge the gap between what AI can do and what operations actually needs. I train hundreds of people, I build POCs myself, and I translate business problems into agent architectures. My work has gotten attention at the CEO level at Estee Lauder, but what excites me most is watching a plant supervisor use something I built to solve a problem they have had for years.

## Why AI Is Where I Belong

I am someone who optimizes things. But once a system is optimized and the gains get smaller and smaller, the excitement fades. That is what drove me through my career: constantly yearning for the next big challenge, the next messy system with room to improve. A car engine, you learn it once and you are done. A manufacturing line, eventually you are maintaining. But AI changes every week, and soon it will be every day. Something new is always emerging: a new capability, a new way to apply it, a new problem that could not be solved before.

AI is my infinite canvas. The toolset keeps growing. The problems never run out. For someone wired the way I am, that is why this field pulls me so hard. I get up at 4:30 AM to learn, I spend evenings watching what is new, I taught myself vibe coding before I knew anyone else doing it. Not because someone told me to. Because I had to understand it.

And the reason I have been able to engage 1,000+ people on AI is not because I mandate adoption. It is because I know how to connect with people, understand the type of work they do, listen to their challenges, and then connect AI to what matters to them. I give people the spark, and then they want to explore further on their own. That is the real way you drive transformation: not top-down mandates, but bottom-up excitement.

## How I Work

My approach is consistent across every challenge:
1. Identify the desired state (what does "done" look like?)
2. Analyze current variables (people, process, technology, constraints)
3. Construct the most efficient path to optimization
4. Build governance and sustainability into the solution from day one
5. Transfer capability so teams can sustain it without me

I use Kotter's 8-Step Change Model as my transformation framework, applied at both Coty (as a certified Leading Bold Change facilitator) and at Estee Lauder. I bring Legal, Privacy, and Compliance in early, not as an afterthought. I build governance before scaling.

I am a practitioner, not just a strategist. I build real things: POCs, pilots, working tools. I am in the weeds with teams, not just presenting slide decks.

## Deep Dive: Lab Cycle Time Transformation

Reduced Quality Testing cycle time from 12 days to 2.7 days (~80% reduction).

### Business Impact

1. **Massive Working Capital Release**
   - Released $30-35M in annual inventory working capital
   - Products spent far less time waiting on testing in Quality Hold

2. **Accelerated Supply Chain Velocity**
   - Finished goods reached DCs nearly two weeks faster
   - Created measurable competitive advantage for trend response (e.g., TikTok-driven spikes)

3. **Improved Return on Assets (ROA)**
   - Less capital tied up in WIP and inventory carry costs
   - Materially improved ROA by shrinking the Quality Hold window

4. **Lean Operating Model Shift**
   - $3.75M annual inventory savings
   - Reduced overturned lab OOS by >80%
   - Contributed to ~90% reduction in audit observations at the site

### How It Was Done

   - Reduced overturned OOS investigations by >80% (cleaner, more capable lab processes)

3. **Strengthened Quality Systems**
   - Micro risk reduction programs
   - Standardized digital recordkeeping
   - Sustained lab cycle-time velocity improvements

### How the $3.75M Annual Savings Were Generated

1. **Eliminated Excess Inventory Carry Costs**
   - Products sat dramatically less time in Quality Hold
   - Faster release to service = less WIP and finished goods trapped in QC
   - Lower average inventory = lower capital burden + reduced storage costs
   - Classic Lean: shorten lead time → inventory collapses proportionally → cash freed

2. **Removed Waste Within Lab Processes**
   - Eliminated redundant waits, rework loops, excessive sample handling, long queues
   - Reduced labor hours on unnecessary retesting
   - Lowered consumables usage and administrative overhead in OOS management

3. **Slashed OOS Investigations (>80% Reduction)**
   - Cleaner data, fewer invalid OOS results, faster issue resolution
   - Reduced QC labor, QA investigation time, re-sampling costs
   - Less material scrap tied to testing-induced delays

4. **Enabled Faster Flow → Higher Throughput Without Added Cost**
   - QC handled more batches with same headcount
   - Manufacturing experienced fewer bottlenecks waiting for release
   - Gained "speed capacity" without new investment

### Summary
"Led a Lean transformation of Quality Testing, reducing cycle time from 12 days to 2.7 days (~80%), unlocking $30-35M in working capital, accelerating supply chain velocity by nearly two weeks, and strengthening ROA. Implemented new analytics, CAPA rigor, and lab operating standards that reduced overturned OOS by >80% and supported a ~90% drop in audit observations."

## Deep Dive: Coty Manufacturing Consolidation & Capability Transfer

Led Quality and Compliance through multi-site consolidation, managing the highest-risk parts of moving a manufacturing operation while sustaining compliance and supply.

### The Challenge
Coty was consolidating manufacturing operations from Phoenix, AZ to Sanford, NC. Significant risk was tied to validation, regulatory posture, external qualification expectations (QVC, e-commerce), and the introduction of new product technology from the Del Laboratories acquisition.

### What I Did
- Owned the end-to-end quality workstream for both sending and receiving sites
- Built ramp-up and ramp-down plans across staffing, equipment, documents, tools, and standards
- Led IQ, OQ, PQ execution and directed equipment and process validation
- Transitioned quality management systems into SAP QM at the receiving site during the consolidation
- Maintained QVC and e-commerce quality certifications while absorbing heavy program demand
- Ran targeted corrective actions for QVC kitting issues using RCPS methodology with sustained performance after changes (zero additional rejects)
- Led the Del Laboratories nail lacquer integration, planning for technology not previously manufactured at Sanford
- Modernized Sanford pre-transfer: upgraded fragrance operation, retail security clamshell packaging, and seasonal kitting to create space and capacity

### The Philosophy
I treated this as a capability transfer, not just a site move. That meant transferring formulas, management systems (QMS and SAP QM), and the human operating model (skills, standards, routines) so the receiving site could sustain qualification requirements and regulated compliance from day one. The playbook ensured the receiving teams had the right people, processes, and tools to remain qualified before the sending site stood down.

### Results
- $39M in first-year savings with no service or compliance disruption
- QVC and e-commerce certifications maintained through the transition
- OTC product manufacturing validated at the receiving site
- Zero additional rejects on QVC kitting after corrective actions
- Foundation laid for ongoing capability, not just a one-time move

### Earlier Coty Accomplishments (Pre-Consolidation)
- 60% reduction in supplier quality incidents through GMP and QMS implementation
- Non-moving inventory reduced from $1.5M to under $200K
- Days on hand reduced from 260 to under 30 through lean controls and daily management
- Leading Bold Change (Kotter) facilitator, driving employee-led savings of several million dollars with improved morale
- These baseline improvements established the credibility and operational maturity that enabled the consolidation to succeed
