## Deep Dive: Lab Cycle Time Transformation

Reduced Quality Testing cycle time from 12 days to 2.7 days (~80% reduction).

### Business Impact

1. **Massive Working Capital Release**
   - Released $30-35M in annual inventory working capital
   - Products spent far less time waiting on testing in Quality Hold

2. **Accelerated Supply Chain Velocity**
   - Finished goods reached DCs nearly two weeks faster
   - Created measurable competitive advantage for trend response (e.g., TikTok-driven spikes)

3. **Improved Return on Assets (ROA)**
   - Less capital tied up in WIP and inventory carry costs
   - Materially improved ROA by shrinking the Quality Hold window

4. **Lean Operating Model Shift**
   - $3.75M annual inventory savings
   - Reduced overturned lab OOS by >80%
   - Contributed to ~90% reduction in audit observations at the site

### How It Was Done

1. **Lean Redesign of Testing Workflow**
   - Streamlined handoffs and queue times
   - Removed non-value-added administrative steps
   - Standardized method execution and analysis flow

2. **Embedded Metrics, Trending & CAPA Discipline**
   - Built and deployed new trending systems and CAPA governance
   - Reduced overturned OOS investigations by >80% (cleaner, more capable lab processes)

3. **Strengthened Quality Systems**
   - Micro risk reduction programs
   - Standardized digital recordkeeping
   - Sustained lab cycle-time velocity improvements

### How the $3.75M Annual Savings Were Generated

1. **Eliminated Excess Inventory Carry Costs**
   - Products sat dramatically less time in Quality Hold
   - Faster release to service = less WIP and finished goods trapped in QC
   - Lower average inventory = lower capital burden + reduced storage costs
   - Classic Lean: shorten lead time → inventory collapses proportionally → cash freed

2. **Removed Waste Within Lab Processes**
   - Eliminated redundant waits, rework loops, excessive sample handling, long queues
   - Reduced labor hours on unnecessary retesting
   - Lowered consumables usage and administrative overhead in OOS management

3. **Slashed OOS Investigations (>80% Reduction)**
   - Cleaner data, fewer invalid OOS results, faster issue resolution
   - Reduced QC labor, QA investigation time, re-sampling costs
   - Less material scrap tied to testing-induced delays

4. **Enabled Faster Flow → Higher Throughput Without Added Cost**
   - QC handled more batches with same headcount
   - Manufacturing experienced fewer bottlenecks waiting for release
   - Gained "speed capacity" without new investment

### Summary
"Led a Lean transformation of Quality Testing, reducing cycle time from 12 days to 2.7 days (~80%), unlocking $30-35M in working capital, accelerating supply chain velocity by nearly two weeks, and strengthening ROA. Implemented new analytics, CAPA rigor, and lab operating standards that reduced overturned OOS by >80% and supported a ~90% drop in audit observations."

## Deep Dive: Coty Manufacturing Consolidation & Capability Transfer

Led Quality and Compliance through multi-site consolidation, managing the highest-risk parts of moving a manufacturing operation while sustaining compliance and supply.

### The Challenge
Coty was consolidating manufacturing operations from Phoenix, AZ to Sanford, NC. Significant risk was tied to validation, regulatory posture, external qualification expectations (QVC, e-commerce), and the introduction of new product technology from the Del Laboratories acquisition.

### What I Did
- Owned the end-to-end quality workstream for both sending and receiving sites
- Built ramp-up and ramp-down plans across staffing, equipment, documents, tools, and standards
- Led IQ, OQ, PQ execution and directed equipment and process validation
- Transitioned quality management systems into SAP QM at the receiving site during the consolidation
- Maintained QVC and e-commerce quality certifications while absorbing heavy program demand
- Ran targeted corrective actions for QVC kitting issues using RCPS methodology with sustained performance after changes (zero additional rejects)
- Led the Del Laboratories nail lacquer integration, planning for technology not previously manufactured at Sanford
- Modernized Sanford pre-transfer: upgraded fragrance operation, retail security clamshell packaging, and seasonal kitting to create space and capacity

### The Philosophy
I treated this as a capability transfer, not just a site move. That meant transferring formulas, management systems (QMS and SAP QM), and the human operating model (skills, standards, routines) so the receiving site could sustain qualification requirements and regulated compliance from day one. The playbook ensured the receiving teams had the right people, processes, and tools to remain qualified before the sending site stood down.

### Results
- $39M in first-year savings with no service or compliance disruption
- QVC and e-commerce certifications maintained through the transition
- OTC product manufacturing validated at the receiving site
- Zero additional rejects on QVC kitting after corrective actions
- Foundation laid for ongoing capability, not just a one-time move

### Earlier Coty Accomplishments (Pre-Consolidation)
- 60% reduction in supplier quality incidents through GMP and QMS implementation
- Non-moving inventory reduced from $1.5M to under $200K
- Days on hand reduced from 260 to under 30 through lean controls and daily management
- Leading Bold Change (Kotter) facilitator, driving employee-led savings of several million dollars with improved morale
- These baseline improvements established the credibility and operational maturity that enabled the consolidation to succeed
