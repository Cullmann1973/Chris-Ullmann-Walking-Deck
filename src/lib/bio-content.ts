## Deep Dive: Program Runway ROI

Program Runway delivered 170% ROI through transformation of operating models, process innovation, and engineering modernization. Here's what drove it:

### 1. Building the Runway NPL Platform
- Investment: $16.1M cross-functional initiative
- Unified launch calendars, dashboards, and workflows into a single source of truth for 25+ brands
- Eliminated delays from fractured spreadsheets and siloed data
- Improved launch sequencing, reducing missed windows and lost revenue
- Accelerated brand readiness through real-time visibility

### 2. Accelerated Value Realization (VRO, COGs, Technology)
From the 6-month update, exceeded business case targets:
- $32M value via COGs workshops, analytics tools, packaging improvements, and automation
- $11.5M value through innovation insourcing (supporting MAC, Clinique, Bobbi Brown, Tom Ford)
- Additional incremental revenue from subcategory optimization and agility LSD projects
- $2.5M indirect employee savings in FY21

### 3. Organizational Design & Efficiency
- Right-sizing org design (+35 FTE baseline with staged reductions/realignments)
- Material and non-labor operating cost savings, tracked and validated
- Improved KPIs around direct materials, misc expense, and operating cost
- Long-term cost-to-serve reductions factored into ROI

### 4. Capital Efficiency & Platform Funding
- Business case approval: $11.8M with $5M+ annual savings and productivity gains
- Decommissioned legacy technology saving $500K+/yr
- Portfolio workspace and milestone automation increased brand, marketing, and finance efficiency

### Summary
"Program Runway delivered 170% ROI by transforming launch governance, accelerating value realization across COGs and innovation, modernizing engineering and digital capabilities, and eliminating structural inefficiencies across the end-to-end value chain."

## Deep Dive: Lab Cycle Time Transformation

Reduced Quality Testing cycle time from 12 days to 2.7 days (~80% reduction).

### Business Impact

1. **Massive Working Capital Release**
   - Released $30-35M in annual inventory working capital
   - Products spent far less time waiting on testing in Quality Hold

2. **Accelerated Supply Chain Velocity**
   - Finished goods reached DCs nearly two weeks faster
   - Created measurable competitive advantage for trend response (e.g., TikTok-driven spikes)

3. **Improved Return on Assets (ROA)**
   - Less capital tied up in WIP and inventory carry costs
   - Materially improved ROA by shrinking the Quality Hold window

4. **Lean Operating Model Shift**
   - $3.75M annual inventory savings
   - Reduced overturned lab OOS by >80%
   - Contributed to ~90% reduction in audit observations at the site

### How It Was Done

1. **Lean Redesign of Testing Workflow**
   - Streamlined handoffs and queue times
   - Removed non-value-added administrative steps
   - Standardized method execution and analysis flow

2. **Embedded Metrics, Trending & CAPA Discipline**
   - Built and deployed new trending systems and CAPA governance
   - Reduced overturned OOS investigations by >80% (cleaner, more capable lab processes)

3. **Strengthened Quality Systems**
   - Micro risk reduction programs
   - Standardized digital recordkeeping
   - Sustained lab cycle-time velocity improvements

### How the $3.75M Annual Savings Were Generated

1. **Eliminated Excess Inventory Carry Costs**
   - Products sat dramatically less time in Quality Hold
   - Faster release to service = less WIP and finished goods trapped in QC
   - Lower average inventory = lower capital burden + reduced storage costs
   - Classic Lean: shorten lead time → inventory collapses proportionally → cash freed

2. **Removed Waste Within Lab Processes**
   - Eliminated redundant waits, rework loops, excessive sample handling, long queues
   - Reduced labor hours on unnecessary retesting
   - Lowered consumables usage and administrative overhead in OOS management

3. **Slashed OOS Investigations (>80% Reduction)**
   - Cleaner data, fewer invalid OOS results, faster issue resolution
   - Reduced QC labor, QA investigation time, re-sampling costs
   - Less material scrap tied to testing-induced delays

4. **Enabled Faster Flow → Higher Throughput Without Added Cost**
   - QC handled more batches with same headcount
   - Manufacturing experienced fewer bottlenecks waiting for release
   - Gained "speed capacity" without new investment

### Summary
"Led a Lean transformation of Quality Testing, reducing cycle time from 12 days to 2.7 days (~80%), unlocking $30-35M in working capital, accelerating supply chain velocity by nearly two weeks, and strengthening ROA. Implemented new analytics, CAPA rigor, and lab operating standards that reduced overturned OOS by >80% and supported a ~90% drop in audit observations."
